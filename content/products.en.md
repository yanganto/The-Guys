# Products & Services

We provide yeast, hops, and other raw materials, along with related services, which are essential components in the beer brewing process.

# What is yeast

_“We make the wort, but yeast makes the beer.”_

it’s just a reminder that yeast is really the one calling the shots during fermentation. Quality in the glass? Yeah, that’s up to those tiny fungi. Humanity’s been riding on yeast’s shoulders for thousands of years: fluffy bread, fine wine, crisp lagers, bold spirits… all of it, thanks to yeast quietly doing its job. We’ve been trying to figure it out since the Industrial Revolution, and guess what? We’re still just scratching the surface of what it can do.

# Hops

_"Hops are the soul of beer."_

Each variety tells its own story — floral, citrus, pine, or tropical. Every harvest carries the craft of growers, and in brewers’ hands, hops become the essence of the beers we share.
